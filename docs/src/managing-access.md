# Managing access

After creating (or uploading) a new document, only you have access to it. You can give other people access to your document by [managing access](#giving-access-by-adding-emails-addresses) in Google Docs and by [a link to the document](#giving-access-by-the-link).

## Giving access by adding emails addresses

To give access to someone if you know their email address:

1. Click **Share**.  
   <img alt="Share button" src="/src/img/share-button.jpg" class="img-border" width="450px">
2. In the dialog box, type the email address.
3. You can choose the role — **Editor**, **Commenter**, or **Viewer**.  

    ???+ info "Description of the roles"

        * **Editor**: the person can make changes, accept or reject suggestions, and share the file with others.
        * **Commenter**: the person can make comments and suggestions, but can't change or share the file with others.
        * **Viewer**: the person can view, but can't change or share the file with others.

4. Click **Send**.  
   <img alt="Giving access by adding emails addresses" src="/src/img/sharing-by-email.jpg" class="img-border" width="450px">

    If you do not want people you shared a document with to receive an email, clear the **Notify people** checkbox.

## Giving access by the link

To give access by the link:

1. Click **Share**.
2. In the dialog box, select **Anyone with the link**.  
   <img alt="Giving access by the link" src="/src/img/sharing-by-link.jpg" class="img-border" width="390px">
3. You can choose the role — **Editor**, **Commenter**, or **Viewer**.  

    ??? info "Description of the roles"

        * **Editor**: the person can make changes, accept or reject suggestions, and share the file with others.
        * **Commenter**: the person can make comments and suggestions, but can't change or share the file with others.
        * **Viewer**: the person can view, but can't change or share the file with others.

4. Click **Copy link** > **Done**.

Now you can send someone the link and give them access to the document.
