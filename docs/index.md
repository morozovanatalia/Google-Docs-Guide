# Google Docs overview

[**Google Docs**](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) is a free online word processor offered by Google. You only **need to have a signed-in Google account** to work in Google Docs. The service is accessible via an internet browser as a web-based application, as a mobile app on Android and iOS, and as a desktop application on Google's Chrome OS.

Google Docs allows users to create and edit documents online. It is also possible to collaborate with other users in real-time. All edits you make are saved automatically and tracked, so you can see what changes were made by different users.

In Google Docs, you can open and save documents in various formats, for example, OpenDocument and Microsoft Word.
